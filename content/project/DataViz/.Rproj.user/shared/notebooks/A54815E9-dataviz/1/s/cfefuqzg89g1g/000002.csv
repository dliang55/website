"0","# Data Visualization Assignment"
"0","# For this assignment you will need to find/secure access to a dataset that you think can be used to tell an interesting story through visualization. Possible sources of data sets include: 1) a data set you've already worked with before (e.g., your undergraduate thesis project); 2) an openly available psychology dataset; 3) one of the previous #TidyTuesday datasets (note, you may not ""double count"" this as a bonus assignment submission); 4) one of the open data sets used by FiveThirtyEight; 5) some other interesting an open data set of your choice (e.g., from a research article with an open data badge). You will need to make 2-4 visualizations (as Wilke notes, it's difficult to tell a story with only one!), and two different ""versions"" of each visualization. Your submission should be submitted as a fully reproducible workflow that must mindlessly knit to word. "
"0","# Note: Part of the correctness points portion of this assignment will draw from the coherence and convincingness of your story, plots, explanations, and justifications. Further, in addition to the normal reproducibility + correctness grading scheme, we will be grading this assignment using a ""complexity multiplier"" that's designed to incentivize folks who want to go the extra mile (tastefully) incorporating more advanced features. This multiplier will be applied following the tallying of reproducibility + correctness points (but the assignment will still cap out at its allotted 10% of final grade amount).:"
